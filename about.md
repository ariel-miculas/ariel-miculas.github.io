My name is Ariel Miculas and I'm a passionate software engineer with a master's
degree in Cybersecurity. My area of interest is systems programming, including
hypervisors, operating systems, and more recently, Linux filesystems.

I'm also an open-source contributor, here are some of the projects I've
contributed to: [Linux
kernel](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220613094927.117961408@linuxfoundation.org/),
[capnproto-rust](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust),
[squashfuse](https://github.com/vasi/squashfuse).

Currently I'm working at Cisco on a [next-generation container
filesystem](https://github.com/project-machine/puzzlefs) and I'm also a teaching
assistant at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, where I untangle the
misteries of the x86 programming language for the unwary first-year students.
